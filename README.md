Develepment Purpose:
Cooking is one of my hobbies, itâ€™s a great way for me to relax. When I eat a delicious dish at a restaurant, I always search for the recipe online and write it down. Then, l use the recipe to try cooking the dish at home. I want to develop an application to save those recipes, which will help me easily manage my growing collection of recipes.
