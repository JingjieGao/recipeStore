# Jingjie Gao Individual Project - Recipe Store

### Problem Statement
Cooking is a relaxing hobby for many people, including me. When I eat a delicious dish at a restaurant, I always search for the recipe online, write it down, and try cooking it at home. However, I believe many people find it challenging to manage a growing collection of recipes. With recipes scattered across different notes, it becomes difficult to find and organize them efficiently. Developing a digital solution is more convenient than writing them on paper. The Recipe Store application will be developed similarly to the [101 Cookbooks website](https://www.101cookbooks.com/), organizing recipes by category. A key difference is that the Recipe Store application is a personal recipe organizer that allows users to manage their own recipes and access them easily. Users can easily add new recipes, update them, and even delete them when needed.
